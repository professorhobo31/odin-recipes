    <h3>A classic Argentinian recipe for pasta lovers.</h3>
    <p>
       "Tuco" is the name of a traditional sauce from countries such as Uruguay, Argentina and Chile, prepared from a tomato base. It's commonly used as a 
       companion for spaghetti, but also for other pasta dishes such as gnocci.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
     <ul>
        <li>1 kg of minced meat</li> 
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>100 ml of sunflower oil</li> 
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>3 leaves of bay tree laurel</li>
        <li>1 spoonful of oregano</li>
        <li>2 spoonfuls of tomato extract</li>
        <li>200 grams of tomato puree</li>
        <li>a pinch of salt</li>
        <li>a pinch of pepper</li>
        <li>ground pepper</li>
        <li>a pack of spaghetti</li>
        <li>parmesan cheese</li>
     </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour a thin layer of oil into a pot. Add the meat to the pot and start heating, chop the onions and garlic into small pieces. Add them to the pot,
                stirring well with a wooden spoon. Once the onions have turned golden brown, you must add the laurel and oregano leaves.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato puree and extract. Add the salt and pepper and keep stirring. Allow the preparation to reach a boil and turn the fire to minimum.</li>
            <li>If needed you could add some water at this point to keep the sauce from sticking to the pot and burning. Don't overdo it however: Tuco should
                always remain a thick sauce.</li>
            <li>Whilst the Tuco is still cooking, add water to a large pot and let it boil. Add a pinch of salt to this water and cook the pasta in it. Once it's done, 
                strain the spaghetti and serve it on a deep plate, adding the Tuco (still boiling hot) on top.</li>
            <li>Grind the parmessan cheese and prinkle it on your plate at leasure.</li>
        </ol>
