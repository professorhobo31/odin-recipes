    <h3>Grandma's favorite.</h3>
    <p>
        Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few 
        ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff!).
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Baking Powder</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>1 whole egg</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift the dry ingredients together. The quantity depends on how many pancakes you want. </li>
            <li>Make a well, then add the wet ingredients. Stir to combine and form a smooth batter.</li>
            <li>Scoop the batter onto a hot griddle or pan.</li>
            <li>Cook until brown on both sides.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>When to flip the pancakes</h3>
    <p>As you can see, it's not hard to make homemade pancakes â€” the list of ingredients, and the steps needed to combine them, are pretty short.
    You just need to pay attention to one important part of the process: the flipping. Thankfully, our master chef Sergio is an expert when it comes to 
    flipping and has given us the secret for perfect pancakes: you should wait until bubbles start to form on the top and the edges look dry and set. 
    This will usually take about two to three minutes on each side, but check the visual clues rather than your watch: it can take more or less time
    depending on the batter, the pan you use, etc.
